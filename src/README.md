#WAR!
###About
Welcome to war!  This is a fun and easy game that can be played with a good 'ol deck of cards or right here in Javascript!
###Rules
After a deck shuffle each player is dealt half of the deck.  The players then draw a card off of the top of their respective hands.  The player whose card is of greater rank wins the draw and puts both cards at the bottom of their hand.  If the cards' ranks are equal 'WAR' is initiated, at which time both players put 3 cards down and draw the 4th to see who wins the draw.  This process is repeated until one player has all of the cards in the deck.
